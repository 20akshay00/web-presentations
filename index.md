# Note

- These are best viewed in full-screen. 
- Use arrow keys to move between slides (including up-down for RevealJS documents).
- Wait a few seconds for the slides and images to render after clicking the link.
- If a certain slide seems strangely rendered (missing image, misaligned latex, etc), just refresh the page.
